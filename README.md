This project used [React Starter Kit](https://www.reactstarterkit.com) as a foundation

### The goal of this project is to create a youtube syncing platform where users can synchronously watch youtube videos together once an account has been created

# State of the Project

- The user auth flow has been completed (logging in and signing out)
- Socket.IO events are being sent in between front end and back end
- Youtube IFRAME is embedded but calls to the youtube API need to be fixed so the videos are displayed dynamically
